# Noted.

## Description
This assignment was to create a note taking application with the starter code provided. The application is runs in the browser.

## Usage
To use this application the user can use this deployed heroku link to access in the broswer and click "Get Started". I recommend using Chrome. --> https://noted-note-tracker.herokuapp.com/

The alternative would be to clone this repository into your local computer via the terminal (MacOS) or git bash (Windows). From there one can access the code via VSCode.

In the command line of the terminal or git bash, type  'npm install' or 'npm install express' to download the node_modules and to install express. 

Then type 'npm start' in the command line, and hit 'enter' or 'return' to start the server. The command line will say that the server is running in the local host and show an http link. 

Copy and paste that http link into the broswer and hit 'enter' or 'return'. 

The homepage of the application will display and you can click 'Get Started'.

Upon accessing the Notes page the user can type a new Note by adding a title in the "Note Title" box.

 The user can add details in "Note Text" area. 
 
 When the "Note Text" area is filled, there will be a Save Icon that will appear on the top right hand next to the "+" icon. 
 
 Click on that button to save your note to the left hand column. You may revisit your notes by clicking on any of the ones you've saved in that column.

 There is a delete icon designed as a trash can next to the saved notes, though it does not work as of yet.

 Below are some mock images of the note tracker.
